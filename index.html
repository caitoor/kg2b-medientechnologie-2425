        Axolotls are a type of salamander that are native to Mexico. They are
        known for their unique ability to regenerate lost body parts, including
        limbs, tails, and even parts of their brain. This remarkable ability has
        made them a popular subject of scientific research, as scientists hope to
        unlock the secrets of regeneration in order to develop new treatments for
        injuries and diseases in humans.
